# Improvements to the Fitbit installer for Mac OS X

Out of the box, the Fitbit software runs with its log output sent straight to Console. This is unnecessarily noisy if you use Console a lot, and bloats the syslog archives. This little Fitbit install fixer-upper will:

- Redirect fitbitd's logs to /var/log/fitbitd.log
- Add an entry to OS X's built-in log rotation to compress and turn over these logs when they get too big.
